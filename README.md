# Quantum Algorithm for Edge Detection in Images

This repository contains the code and data for my thesis project on edge detection using quantum algorithms. 
The project demonstrates edge detection for small images at varying resolutions, utilizing quantum methods to identify image boundaries.

## Contents

The repository includes the following:

- **5 Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)**:
    - `example8x8.ipynb` - Edge detection for an image of resolution 8x8
    - `quan_imag_alg_16.ipynb` - Edge detection for an image of resolution 16x16
    - `quantum_edge_project64.ipynb` - Edge detection for an image of resolution 64x64
    - `quantum_edge_project128.ipynb` - Edge detection for an image of resolution 128x128
    - `quantum_edge_project256.ipynb` - Edge detection for an image of resolution 256x256

- **Images**:
    - **Input images**: Located in the `input_images` folder. These are the original images used for edge detection.
    - **Output images**: Located in the `output_images` folder. These contain the images with detected edges as produced by the quantum algorithm.

## Project Overview

This thesis explores a quantum algorithm designed to perform edge detection on small images. The algorithm was tested on five images of different resolutions:
- 8x8
- 16x16
- 64x64
- 128x128
- 256x256

Edge detection is a fundamental problem in image processing, and quantum computing offers new ways to approach such tasks with the potential for significant computational speedups. 
The notebooks include the complete implementation of the quantum edge detection algorithm, along with visualizations of the results.
